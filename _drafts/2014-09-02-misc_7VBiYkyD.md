I spend quite a bit of time working on my dotfiles. The nicer the environment
the easier it is to work. Since the beginning of the year I have made 63
commits bringing the total to 292 since I started the keeping dotfiles since
March 2012.

## Terminal

While looking at a lot of other peoples configurations, I realized a lot of
other people using [iTerm2][ITERM2]. However, Since I used Linux rather than OS
X, I have to use another terminal: [urxvt][URXVT]. It doesn't have the fancy
GUI that iTerm2 has to configure the terminal which is fine for normal use
since I don't have to change options much once I have found a comfortable
configuration. But I use a small font on a dark background, which is not great
for presentations. To rectify this I use gnome-terminal and gvim (gnome-vim)
which have been set up with a large font and light background.
