    I am a Canadian left-handed redhead with interests. I canoe and compute.

I am a graduate of the University of Guelph with a degree in Computer Science
from the faculty of Computing.  I worked at Camp Big Canoe for a number of years
and keen canoeist.

In the summer of 2014 I worked with professor [Fei Song][FEISONG] on a project
performing sentiment analysis in twitter messages.  The simple system used a
maximum entropy classifier with [nltk][NLTK].  You can read the paper I wrote
about it [here][PAPER]
