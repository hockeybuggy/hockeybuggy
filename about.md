I also am a [ORCKA][ORCKA] Basic canoeing instructor. I also have some other
fancy sounding certifications like Canadian Style Paddling lvl 2 and Canoe
Tripping level 2.

I used these certifications at [Camp Big Canoe][CBC] since 2009.  During my
summers working at camp I worked as a Counsellor(2009), Canoeing Instructor and
member of the waterfront team (2010), director of Music & Drama (2011), and
Administrative Assistant (2012). Because I wanted used my Canoeing instructors
at camp, I also have my [NLS][NLS] allowing me to lifeguard in Canada.

In the summer of 2013, I worked at Sears Canada doing marketing analytics and
volunteering as a lifeguard on a canoe trip on the French river with [CBC][CBC].
