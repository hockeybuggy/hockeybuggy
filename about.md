Also, I am a [ORCKA][ORCKA] Basic canoeing instructor and have some other
fancy sounding certifications like Canadian Style Paddling lvl 2 and Canoe
Tripping level 2.

I used these certifications at [Camp Big Canoe][CBC] since 2009.  During my
summers working at camp I worked as a Counsellor(2009), Canoeing Instructor and
member of the waterfront team (2010), director of Music & Drama (2011), and
Administrative Assistant (2012).

In the summer of 2014 I worked with professor [Fei Song][FEISONG] on a project
performing sentiment analysis in twitter messages using the dataset from the
[SEMEVAL 2013 workshop][SEMEVAL]. The simple system used a maximum entropy
classifier implemented using python and [nltk][NLTK]. It's pretty cool stuff;
You can read the paper I wrote about it [here][PAPER] or [checkout the
code][REPO].
