I have fallen behind on these pages of the day (Ten days) so I am gonna try to
catch up if I can.

If you are looking for a interesting read I recommend the pages about the world
of J. R. R. Tolkien. The scale of his fiction is amazing and full of detail that
there is a wikipedia page on it.

Take a look at the [The Fourth Age](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Age) if
you want to know what happens to the world after the Lord of the Rings books.
