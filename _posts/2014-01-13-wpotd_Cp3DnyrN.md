Today's wikipedia page is about the amazing [Graça Machel][page]. This amazing
woman has been both the first lady of Mozambique (Samora Machel) and the first lady of South
Africa (Nelson Mandela 1998-1999). 

While some may people consider it a sad testament that her power comes from her
husband rather then her own actions but I think that Graça should not be
overlooked as a strong leader.
