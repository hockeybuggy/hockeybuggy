Whenever I tell someone what my email is or what my website's url is, I get
asked about the name hockeybuggy. 

## Back in the day

At the beginning of time[^1], gmail did not exist. On April 1st of 2004 Google
announced the Gmail beta. At first the beta was invite only. Once you were
invited to get a Gmail account you received 10 invites you could send others.

On January 31st 2005 I received an invite from my older sister. Being young I
foolishly did not get douglasanderson&#g64;gmail.com. Instead, I got
hockeybuggy&#64;gmail.com, a combination of my favourite sport at the time:
hockey and a modification of what my family calls me: buggy[^2]

## Why Keep It?

I have the name just about everywhere on the web. Since I have the .com  as
well as the same username on Github, Google, and Twitter, I don't think I will be changing it any time soon.
