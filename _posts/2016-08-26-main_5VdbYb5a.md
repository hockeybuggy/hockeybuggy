I switched to using relative line numbers in May and I thought I should share a
bit about my experiences with it so far. In preemptive summary, my impression
so far is "OMG where have you been all my life `relnumbers`!".

## In the beginning

Many people that I see using vim have in their `.vimrc`

``` vimscript
  set number  " Show absolute line numbers in the gutter starting from line one
```

Seeing line numbers in vim is great. I give you an idea of where you are in a
file, particularly if you just jumped there from a search and are a little
disoriented. This seemed like indispensable information until I switched and
realized that I didn't miss it.

## The enlightenment

// jumping like a #ninja

``` vimscript
  set relitivenumber  " Show line numbers in the gutter relitive to the location of the cursor
```
// gif of the line numbers

// no more visual mode yanks

## Overcoming the downsides

// jumping via `:123`

// switching back via unimpaired
