I switched to using relative line numbers in May and I thought I should share a
bit about my experiences with it so far. In preemptive summary, my impression
so far is "OMG where have you been all my life `relnumbers`!".

## In the beginning

Many people that I see using vim have in their `.vimrc`

``` VimL
  set number  " Show absolute line numbers in the gutter starting from line one
```

Seeing line numbers in vim is great. I give you an idea of where you are in a
file, particularly if you just jumped there from a search and are a little
disoriented. This seemed like indispensable information until I switched and
realized that I didn't miss it.

In the gif above to delete the method I am pressing `Vjjjjd` for
*V*isual-line mode, down, down down, down, *d*elete.

## The enlightenment

// jumping like a #ninja

``` VimL
  set relativenumber  " Show line numbers relative to the location of the cursor
```

In the gif above I am deleting the same method with `d3j`. This is *d*elete and
then the motion "3 down". It's easy to tell how many times I need to move down
while in relative line mode since it's written in the gutter.

// no more visual mode yanks

## Overcoming the downsides

// jumping via `:123`

// switching back via unimpaired
