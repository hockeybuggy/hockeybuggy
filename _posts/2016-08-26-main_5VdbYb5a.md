I switched to using relative line numbers in May and I thought I should share a
bit about my experiences with it so far. In preemptive summary, my impression
so far is "OMG where have you been all my life `relnumbers`!".

## In the beginning

Many people that I see using vim have in their `.vimrc`

``` VimL
  set number  " Show absolute line numbers in the gutter starting from line one
```

Seeing line numbers in vim is great. I give you an idea of where you are in a
file, particularly if you just jumped there from a search and are a little
disoriented. This seemed like indispensable information until I switched and
realized that I didn't miss it.

In the gif above to delete the method I am pressing `Vjjjjd` for
*V*isual-line mode, down, down down, down, *d*elete.

## The enlightenment

Turing on relative line number makes me feel like I am jumping around like a
ninja&trade;. By giving `j` and `k` a count you don't have to feel like you're
mashing them just to get where you want.

``` VimL
  set relativenumber  " Show line numbers relative to the location of the cursor
```

In the gif above I am deleting the same method with `d3j`. This is *d*elete and
then the motion "3 down". It's easy to tell how many times I need to move down
while in relative line mode since it's written in the gutter. This solution
takes three lowercase keystrokes compared to the visual mode solution that take
6 mixed case keystrokes.

## Overcoming the downsides

One of the down sides of the alternate line numbering system is that it can be
harder to find your absolute position. For example, if you have a test that is
failing you want to jump to the line that is causing an error. Without absolute
line numbers this can seem harder, however the Ex command `:123` will jump to
line 123.

When you really want to switch back to seeing the absolute line numbers in a
file running `:set num` is enough to switch back. Alternatively, using the
[unimpaired][UNIMPAIRED] you can switch between the two numbering schemes with
`con` and `cor`. A good mnemoic for these are "*c*hange *o*ption *n*umber" and
"*c*hange *o*ption *r*elative number"

## TL;DR;

If you haven't tried out relative line numbers in vim give a shot.
