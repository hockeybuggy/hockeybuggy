[The world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_%28archipelago%29) is a
series of small islands near Dubai. The islands have been unpopulated for a
while but recently has seen potential to be built upon. I strongly believe that
if you are looking for an evil hideaway with a great commute time look no
further then a small piece of Asia. Check it at [google maps](https://goo.gl/maps/2qKX7).


However [Open street
map](https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=25.216667&mlon=55.166667&zoom=12&layers=M)
has the islands labeled.  Now that's interesting! These labels while questionably
accurate start to cast a light on the layout of The World.

We can see that South America and Africa are the same size as green land. To me
this indicates that the islands are based on a Mercator projection of the
world. As well the questionable choice of Canadian provinces and multiple
islands for the U.A.E. makes me think that the islands were planned by one of
the Emirati people rather then a foreign architect.
