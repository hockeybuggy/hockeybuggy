One of my favorite member of history is the younger brother of the great
Carthaginian leader Hannibal. My first dog will defiantly be called
[Hasdrubal]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasdrubal_(Barcid)).

Make sure to check out the further link at the end for more Carthaginians of the 
[same name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasdrubal).
