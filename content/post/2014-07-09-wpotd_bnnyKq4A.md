Today I discovered from the fount of knowledge that is Wikipedia, about [switch
pitchers][switch_pitcher]. While there are many switch hitters (a
person who can hit both left and right) playing baseball today, It is
incredibly rare for a pitcher to pitch with more than one hand.

According to Wikipedia the first switch pitcher in the major leagues is a
'[dead ball era][dead_ball]' player: [Tony Mullane][tony]. He played without a
glove so switching was very easy for him. Another two contemporary pitchers
followed his lead (see [switch pitcher page][switch_pitcher]).

The only modern pitcher to pitch is the majors is [Greg Harris][greg], although
he only pitched left in his penultimate game against the expos.

The last pitcher I read about is [Pat Venditte][pat], who is currently an
active pitcher in the minor leagues. Pat has pitched switch his whole life and
even prompted a rule to be created. The 'Pat Venditte' rule [8.01(f)] reads as follows:

    A pitcher must indicate visually to the umpire-in-chief, the batter and any
    runners the hand with which he intends to pitch, which may be done by wearing
    his glove on the other hand while touching the pitcherâ€™s plate. The pitcher is
    not permitted to pitch with the other hand until the batter is retired, the
    batter becomes a runner, the inning ends, the batter is substituted for by a
    pinch-hitter or the pitcher incurs an injury. In the event a pitcher switches
    pitching hands during an at-bat because he has suffered an injury, the pitcher
    may not, for the remainder of the game, pitch with the hand from which he has
    switched. The pitcher shall not be given the opportunity to throw any
    preparatory pitches after switching pitching hands. Any change of pitching
    hands must be indicated clearly to the umpire-in-chief

This rule weirdly makes a lot of sense.
