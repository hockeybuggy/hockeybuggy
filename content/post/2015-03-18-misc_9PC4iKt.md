In November I started working at an awesome Toronto Company called [Vantage
Analytics][VANTAGE] where I have the pleasure of writing Python everyday.
While working there, I ended up getting sick of typing `python manage.py` over
and over again, so I created some bash and zsh aliases for Python.

### Python aliases

These are for any Python project:

    alias -r ipy="ipython"
    alias -r pipir="pip install -r requirements.txt"
    alias -r rmpyc="find . -name \*.pyc -delete && echo 'pyc files removed.'"

I really like `rmpyc` since I can never remember the arguments for `find`.

### Django aliases

And these are for Django projects (or for running any script named manage.py I guess)

    alias -r pm="python manage.py"
    alias -r pmsh="python manage.py shell"
    alias -r pmt="python manage.py test"
    alias -r pmrs="python manage.py runserver"
    alias -r pmm="python manage.py migrate"
    alias -r pmmm="python manage.py makemigrations"

Send me a message if you have any other fun or useful aliases.
