This my personal website is a place I use to try out new things.

## History of the site

TODO write about the history of the site

### The fuzzy pre-git history

I originally setup the domain sometime in high school (late grade 9 maybe? I
don't really remember). I believe that the very first version of the site was a
static HTML page. At the time I was learning some basic HTML, PHP, and cgi-bin
Perl with my uncle.

The first version of the site I can find was one from 2nd year when I was in my
second year University.

## Plans for the future

I don't really have specific plans for the site. I like having a place to try
out new ideas with low stakes and it will continue to be used for that purpose.
I will also use the site to improve my writing, which like all skills require
practice.
