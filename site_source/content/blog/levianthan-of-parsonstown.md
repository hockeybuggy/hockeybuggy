Yesterday I was reading a wonderful [article][medium] about early astronomy and
the contributions of [Isaac Roberts][roberts]. But it was not the work that
Roberts did at the turn of the century that caught my interest but, another
earlier telescope.

[The Leviathan of Parsonstown][telescope] was huge telescope built in Ireland
around 1850.  From this wikipedia page I not only learn about various types of
reflector telescopes, but I learnt about [Speculum metal][speculum] and it's use in
mirrors. The telescope was rebuild in 1997.
